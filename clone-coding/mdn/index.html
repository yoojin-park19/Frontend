                    <p>Firefox 93 comes with lots of lovely updates including AVIF image format support, filling of XFA-based forms in its PDF viewer and protection against insecure downloads by blocking downloads relying on insecure connections.The post Lots to see in Firefox 93! appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.</p>

                    <h3>Implementing form filling and accessibility in the Firefox PDF viewer</h3>
                    <p>Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn’t support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users' lives easier.The post Implementing form filling and accessibility in the Firefox PDF viewer appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

                    <h3>Control your data for good with Rally</h3>
                    <p>In a world where data and AI are reshaping society, people currently have no tangible way to put their data to work for the causes they believe in. To address this, we built the Rally platform, a first-of-its-kind tool that enables you to contribute your data to specific studies and exercise consent at a granular level. Mozilla Rally puts you in control of your data while building a better Internet and a better society.

                    <h3>Tab Unloading in Firefox 93</h3>
                    <p>Starting with Firefox 93, Firefox will monitor available system memory and, should it ever become so critically low that a crash is imminent, Firefox will respond by unloading memory-heavy but not actively used tabs. This feature is currently enabled on Windows and will be deployed later for macOS and Linux as well.The post Tab Unloading in Firefox 93 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.
